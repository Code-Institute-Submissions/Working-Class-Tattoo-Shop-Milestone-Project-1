# Milestone Project 1 - Working Class Tattoo Shop

This is a website for a small tattoo shop in Oslo that I get my tattoos done at. They were in need of a website to be able to showcase what they can do to a larger audience. 
Also, with a website that allows users to fill out information on who they want to contact for a tattoo, it makes it more time efficient for both the artists and the customer.
 
## UX
 
This is a very simple and straightforward  website that I made for anyone who could be interested in getting a new tattoo. With a form for contacting a specific artist or whoever is free, a customer can be in direct communication with the artisrt of their choice.

It's a single page, scrolling website that allows the user to quickly look for and find what they are looking for, whether it's contact information, a gallery of some of the artists work or just a shop phone number.

### Business goals

- To be able to showcase artist work + what services are offered
- get new bookings easily through "contact us" form
- drive traffic to each artists Instagram accounts
- inform customers of location using map

### Customer goals

- quickly and easily see what products are offered
- learn about specific tattoo artist & check even more of their work on Instagram
- be able to quickly contact a specific artist I like
- know about what to expect & where to find the shop and contact in case I need to

## Existing Features

There are 4 sections in total on this site:
1. Gallery - carousel type gallrey with few photos of previous work
2. Artists - profile and factoids of each shop artist with links to each of their Instagram accounts
3. Contact - form asking for name, email, drop down choice of artist desired, and a section for tattoo ideas from customer.
4. Shop info - shop rules and a responsive Google maps of shop location.

### Features Left to Implement

In "Artists" section, I would love to implement a modal when clicking on a certain artist name that would pop up with a carousel gallery of some of their specific works.
In "contact us" form, I want to add a attachment link, so it's possible a customer can add photos of a tattoo examples they want the artist to work off of.


## Technologies Used

- HTML 
- CSS
- Boostrap 4
- Google Fonts
- Git Pages (for deployment)


## Testing

All forms have been checked for required details.
Site has been tested on various browsers and screen sizes.
All outbound links open new browser tab, so user can stay on site with no need to take any extra steps.

Have noticed that section images take a bit longer than expected to load, but generally do so within acceptable timeframe.

Code validator https://validator.w3.org/ has been used for both HTML and CSS code, with very few Warnings (2 hyphens in a row) and a couple of Errors that don't seem to affect use of site.

## Deployment

This project was created using Github and gitpod.io was used to write this code. From there, git commits were used to push to my my GitHub repository.
I've used GitPages to deploy this site from my repository with the following steps:

- On Github navigate to /diomcferreira/Working-Class-Tattoo-Shop-Milestone-Project-1
- From menu at the top, click on settings.
- Scroll down to the GitHub pages section.
- Under Source section click on dropdown menu and select "Master Branch" as your GitHub pages publishing source.
- Select save.
- Enjoy.

To create a local repository follow those steps:

- Go to Github Project Repository
- Under the repository name click Clone or download
- In the 'Clone with HTTPs section' clone URL for the repository.
- Open Git Bash in your local platform.
- Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
- Type git clone, and then paste the URL copied earlier: git clone https://github.com/diomcferreira/Working-Class-Tattoo-Shop-Milestone-Project-1
- After pressing ENTER your local clone will be created.
- Enjoy.

### Media

All photos in this project were used with permission and/or taken by me for this project alone. 

### Acknowledgements

I received inspiration for this project from having been to this tattoo shop for a number of tattoos and becoming friends with the owner and artists. Realized they did not have a website and thought it was a good challenge for my first project.
I want to thank all the staff at Working Class Tattoo Shop for all that they do and for the photos they provided me for using on this project.
