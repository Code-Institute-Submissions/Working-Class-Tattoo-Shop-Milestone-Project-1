# Milestone Project 1 - Working Class Tattoo Shop

This is a website for a small tattoo shop in Oslo that I get my tattoos done at. They were in need of a website to be able to showcase what they can do to a larger audience. 
Also, with a website that allows users to fill out information on who they want to contact for a tattoo, it makes it more time efficient for both the artists and the customer.
 
## UX
 
This is a very simple and straightforward  website that I made for anyone who could be interested in getting a new tattoo. With a form for contacting a specific artist or whoever is free, a customer can be in direct communication with the artisrt of their choice.

It's a single page, scrolling website that allows the user to quickly look for and find what they are looking for, whether it's contact information, a gallery of some of the artists work or just a shop phone number.

### Business goals

- To be able to showcase artist work + what services are offered
- get new bookings easily through "contact us" form
- drive traffic to each artists Instagram accounts
- inform customers of location using map

### Customer goals

- quickly and easily see what products are offered
- learn about specific tattoo artist & check even more of their work on Instagram
- be able to quickly contact a specific artist I like
- know about what to expect & where to find the shop and contact in case I need to

## Existing Features

There are 4 sections in total on this site:
1. Gallery - carousel type gallrey with few photos of previous work
2. Artists - profile and factoids of each shop artist with links to each of their Instagram accounts
3. Contact - form asking for name, email, drop down choice of artist desired, and a section for tattoo ideas from customer.
4. Shop info - shop rules and a responsive Google maps of shop location.

### Features Left to Implement

In "Artists" section, I would love to implement a modal when clicking on a certain artist name that would pop up with a carousel gallery of some of their specific works.
In "contact us" form, I want to add a attachment link, so it's possible a customer can add photos of a tattoo examples they want the artist to work off of.


## Technologies Used

- HTML 
- CSS
- Boostrap 4
- Google Fonts
- Git Pages (for deployment)


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This project was created using Github and gitpod.io was used to write this code. From there, git commits were used to push to my my GitHub repository.
I've used GitPages to deploy this site from my repository with the following steps:

Login to my GitHub account
Go to the  repository
Go to the settings-tab
Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section
At the GitHub Pages section, choose "master branch" as your source
The page will now automatically refresh and the repository deployed
You can now scroll down again to the GitHub Pages section to retrieve the link for the website
To run this project locally the following steps should be followed:

You can follow this link to the repository
Click on the green colored button "Clone or download"
Copy the URL that pops up
In your local IDE open Git Bash
The next step is to change your current working directory to the location you want for your cloned directory
Now type in "git clone" and paste the copied URL
When you press Enter your local clone will be created

### Media

All photos in this project were used with permission and/or taken by me for this project alone. 

### Acknowledgements

I received inspiration for this project from having been to this tattoo shop for a number of tattoos and becoming friends with the owner and artists. Realized they did not have a website and thought it was a good challenge for my first project.
I want to thank all the staff at Working Class Tattoo Shop for all that they do and for the photos they provided me for using on this project.
